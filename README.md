# WebDriver Project with Cucumber-JVM Integration

Adopt the previous task (WebDriver project with patterns implemented) to make possible test execution with Cucumber-JVM. 
Follow relevant configuration steps for jUnit/TestNg depending on the existing project architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least one test should use the "Scenario Outline" keyword and the “Examples:” section.
- Apply the “Background” keyword for preconditions/recurrent steps.
- Use filtering/regular expressions in Gherkin step definitions for parametrization and flexibility.
